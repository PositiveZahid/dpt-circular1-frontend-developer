# Sourav Samkaria's Flight Details Project

## Description

This project, built using **TypeScript**, **React 18**, **Next.js**, and **Tailwind CSS**, is a flight details application. It fetches data from an API and displays it in a modern design system created with Tailwind CSS. The project leverages TypeScript for defining type safety throughout the codebase, ensuring more robust and error-free code.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone git@github.com:Sourav7Samkaria/dpt-circular3-frontend-developer.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```
   npm install
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

3. **Start the development server**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   # or
   pnpm dev
   # or
   bun dev
   ```

4. **Open the application** in your browser at http://localhost:3000.

## Project Features

- **Flight Data Table**: The application displays a comprehensive table of flight data. This table includes key details about each flight, such as the flight number, departure and arrival times, and the status of the flight.

- **Form Inputs**: The application includes various forms for user input. These forms can be used to add new flights, update existing flight details, and more. The forms are designed with user experience in mind, making it easy for users to input and submit their data.

- **Real-Time Updates**: The application is designed to provide real-time updates on flight status. This ensures that users always have the most up-to-date information about their flights.

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: The application leverages Next.js's server-side rendering capabilities. This means that the initial page load is faster and the application is more SEO-friendly.

- **API Integration**: The application integrates with an external API to fetch the flight data. This allows the application to display real-time, accurate information about a wide range of flights.

## Time Spent on the Project

Approximately **7 hours** were spent on completing this project. The major challenge was setting up the API using Next.js's built-in features and ensuring best coding practices throughout the project.

## Best Practices Implemented

- **TypeScript Usage**: Leveraged TypeScript to define types for better type safety and code clarity.
- **Component Reusability**: Utilized reusable components to structure the code and reduce redundancy.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Implemented Tailwind CSS for a modern design system, following Tailwind's color configurations for consistency.
- **Next.js API Routes**: Created API routes with Next.js to handle data fetching and seamlessly integrate with React components.
- **Fullstack Approach**: Used the Next.js API feature to create backend logic and consume it in frontend components, showcasing a fullstack approach.
